# Architecting Success: A Tailored Database System for Efficient E-Bookstore Management

## üìö Introduction
The E-Bookstore, based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, houses an extensive collection of books across various genres, sourced from multiple publishers. As the business expanded, the management initiated the development of an online store to reach a broader customer base and streamline book purchases. 

The project at hand involves designing and implementing a robust database system to support the operations of this newly established electronic bookstore.

## üìã Business Rules
- The bookstore purchases books from publisher which are then sell to its members. The bookstore manager compiles a list of needed books and sends an order to the publishers. The publisher supplies the ordered books to the university. The bookstore manager records the details of a new books that have arrived at the bookstore. An invoice is sent to the accounts department to be processed and payment made.
- Anyone who wish to purchase books online, need to initially register as members. Members will be able to view the book info and read reviews.
- Members who wish to purchase can select their books into the shopping cart. The cart will show the summary of the selection and total cost to be paid. Once the payment is made, the bookstore will send the books to the members within 7 working days.
- The database should manage information about books in the bookstore, members and books they have ordered.
- Member can also provide review for a book, as a rating (1-10 which is 1= terrible, 10= masterpiece) along with optional short text. No changes are allowed; only one review per member per book is allowed.
